   - taught App::HI how to list all the colors
   - XXX: interestingly, I can modify the color stack in %ENV, no reason to do
     the weird scope hacking; project for later I guess
     (There's also a coloralias() sub now, but you can't replace standard
     colors, so it's not useful here.)
   - use color() and colorvalid() instead of more scope hacking
   - export color() and colorvalid() (et al) insteadof scope hacking
   - move most of the hi command to App::HI
   - changed my mind on black and pitch.  Reversing them.
   - black is black, pitch is bold black; emotional problems solved.  Hrm,
     coal.  Maybe coal?  Heck, I put that too.
